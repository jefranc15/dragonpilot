"""DNGA V5.0 coast-first longitudinal policy.

V5.0 keeps 0x273 neutral during coast and hydraulic braking, releases normal
moving 0x271 braking into coast when measured/PID demand shows the car is
already slowing enough, and removes the normal moving READY/pump release tail
that V4.3.10 logs showed could keep RPM rising after hydraulic release.

Brake-specific 0x275 word-0 plus 0x08C friction remain the hard propulsion
veto. Raw torque-related 0x275/0x2C9/0x12A/0x125 values remain logging-only.
